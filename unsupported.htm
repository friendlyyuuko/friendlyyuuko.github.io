<!--The HTML is super basic so DOS, Unix terminals and older browsers can still browse the homepage.-->
<!--For context, this page in Lynx (a terminal web browser for Linux.) displays the page perfectly with no defects.-->
<!--For really old browsers, we cannot safely assume they support the modern styles used on the full homepage.-->
<!--Older browsers - (w95-era and before the founding of W3C in 1994) had wildly different HTML implementations and standards.-->
